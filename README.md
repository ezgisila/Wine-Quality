[UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository:](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

This dataset, created by merging two other datasets, contains observations on various red and white wine varieties, including their chemical properties and rankings by tasters. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

**The data sets have 1599 rows of red wine and 4898 rows of white wine. Each wine sample has the following characteristics (columns):**

1. Fixed acidity
2. Volatile acidity
3. Citric acid
4. Residual sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free sulfur dioxide
7.	Total sulfur dioxide
8.	Density
9.	pH
10.	Sulphates
11.	Alcohol
12.	Quality *(score between 0 and 10)*
